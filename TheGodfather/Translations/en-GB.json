Players take turns placing discs on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any discs of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disc of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. The objective of the game is to have the majority of discs turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled.",
  "str-game-rps": "Rock paper scissors is a game usually played between two players, in which each player simultaneously chooses one of three shapes. These shapes are **rock**, **paper** and **scissors**. The game has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors (*rock crushes scissors* or sometimes *blunts scissors*), but will lose to one who has played paper (*paper covers rock*); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors (*scissors cuts paper*). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.",
